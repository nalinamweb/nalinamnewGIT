NALINAM TAMIL WORD PROCESSOR (VER 3.0)
--------------------------------------
This is the first Tamil Word Processing Program with a Tamil user interface.
All your commands are in Tamil and it is user friendly. You don't have to 
memorise commands. You just have to know Tamil to use the program and 
very minimum computer knowledge. It is a freeware program. 
I would indeed be happy if you could distribute Nalinam among your friends. 
You can use it to type letters, documents and print with 10
different fonts : small font, italic font, bold font, bold italic font 
big font and many others. It has also the fastest keyboard layout ever 
designed. With your eight fingers on the keyboard you can type almost 51% of 
your document without lifting your fingers. It also allows you to create 
your own fonts using the nalifont utility which comes together with the 
nalinam program. You may modify existing fonts if you wish to do so.
